[CSC360 Summer 2013](http://webhome.csc.uvic.ca/~mcheng/360/summer.2013/) Repository
========
This is the repository for Computer Science 360: Operating Systems course at UVic over Summer 2013.
I'm open-sourcing this since there is very little support for ROSE and ROSE based questions out there.

Keep in mind, even though my code is open source, ROSE itself and parts of the underlying structure (such as the custom java build and the UVic disk and posix threads) are not distributed under this license. By viewing the code in this repository, you agree that you've read this and understand the risks of stealing code, of which I take no responsibility :)
